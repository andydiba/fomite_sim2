#config file basics...
#
# $key = value   or  $key = value0, value1, value2    etc...   i.e. value(s) are in CSV format
# Note:
#	1.	spaces/tabs are ignored, so $N=5,35  is the same as $N = 5 ,35  or $ N  =  5  ,  3 5
#	2.	key and string values are case sensitive
#	3.	all values are stored as character strings (typecasting e.g. atof occurs within program.)
#	4.1 Essential keys are in CAPITALS, lowercase are arbitrary 'labels' for keys with scope within config file that 'point' to another data structure.
#	4.2 Values can 'point' to another key label for making complex data structures (see ^)
#	5.	Don't insert comments '#' on same line as key=value
#	6.	Can't use maths i.e. DON'T do  $key = 60*60*24
#	7.	Watch out for empty spaces on lines left blank! (they should all be LF/CR). Also max key size ~80, max value ~280 characters.

#Simulates 2 zones (A,B) where a with 1 zone (A) initially contaminated.
# 20 People visit A->B or B->A with equal probability , 10 visit only A or B (with equal likelihood) then leave the sim.
# 1 person only visits B (Bob), another 1 person only visits A (Alice), and another (Balice\Alob??)does either A->B or B->A.
# Thus 5 groups in total. Timing is such that these 3 individuals are (on average) in middle of cues
# It's of interest to see the risk of infection from secondary+ sources
# Can also assess (ID50  / pathogen SHED), Cleaning rate (at A,B and A+B) and Inoc Period, using baseline defaults for all other params
# an also plot pathogen levels on surfaces (w and w/ loss) for illustrative purposes?
